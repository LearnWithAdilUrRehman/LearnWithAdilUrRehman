## 📌 About
I am a Computer Science undergraduate with a strong foundation in programming, software design, and creative problem-solving. My journey into technology began early—studying computer science independently when formal resources were limited—and has since evolved into hands-on experience across software development, graphic design, and web technologies.

I focus on **building**, not just learning: writing clean code, designing real products, and understanding how technology scales in real-world systems. Alongside my technical growth, I bring strong communication skills developed through fieldwork, teamwork, and leadership roles.
